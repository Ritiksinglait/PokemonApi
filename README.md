# PokemonApi
This project is properly  authenticated ,and it stores the data according to the user input,it basically stores which pokemon u have selected
In this project i have implemented user authentications on three levels , from the browser side , from the database , and obviously on client side .
In this project , I have  to used an api ,which stores the information of some pokemons on the basis of httere strengths . i have to use them and create a gui for that ,which stores the users favourite pokemon.
Api fetching is not completed yet .
